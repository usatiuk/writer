A simple web/markdown-based notebook thingy

This is a notebook app written in typescript using koa for the backend and react+redux for the frontend.

## Getting started

You need to create a ormconfig.json file, you can use ormconfig.example.json as, well, an example (you only need to change the database connection settings)

Then start with `npm run dev`

Parcel will be listening at http://localhost:1234, and koa at http://localhost:3000
